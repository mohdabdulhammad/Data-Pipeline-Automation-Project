Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline with Machine Learning

Project Detail
This project delivers a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn, combining robust data preprocessing with advanced predictive analytics. The system processes raw customer data through a series of automated cleaning and transformation steps, then utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict the likelihood of customer churn. This end-to-end solution helps businesses identify at-risk customers early, enabling proactive retention strategies and improved customer relationship management.
Short Description / Purpose
The Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline aims to solve a critical business challenge: identifying customers likely to discontinue services before they actually churn. By leveraging machine learning and automated data processing, this solution provides accurate churn predictions and insights into factors influencing customer decisions, enabling businesses to take targeted retention actions and optimize customer satisfaction strategies.

Example
A telecommunications company needs to predict which customers are likely to cancel their services in the next month. Using this pipeline:
They input their historical customer data
The system automatically processes and cleans the data
The model identifies high-risk customers
The company receives both predictions and insights about key churn factors
Based on these insights, they implement targeted retention strategies
